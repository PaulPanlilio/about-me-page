  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I'm a chess game player. And I love to win. That's why I'm always hungry to learn, grow and succeed not only in playing chess game but in the game of life!</p>
  <p>And now the same feeling I'm leveraging in my journey in Front End Web Development.</p>
  <p>It all started when I need an Ecommerce website for my online store. When I learned that it's so freaking expensive to hire someone to do the website, I kept my money and I study instead on how to create one and grew from there.</p>
  <p>I'm really excited, inspired and focus in this journey!</p>

  <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
  <p>I'm from Manila, Philippines.</p>
  <p>I graduated (B.S. in Industrial Engineering) in Manila as a working-student due to financial crisis. I need to work for nine hours a day. And sleep for four to six hours. Then go to school and study for five to seven hours. But, in spite of that, I managed to survive and thrive on those circumstances. My eyes is always on the price. With all those experiences I would say I have learned so much about myself, other people and how to live in this world. I have learned to manage my time, relationships and resources properly. And I believe I became a better person.</p>
